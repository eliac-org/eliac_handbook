\section{Physical Demonstrations}

\subsection{Demonstration Categories}

\subsubsection{Level 0: Virtual Demonstration}
No physical hardware required. Teams present:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item CAD models and renderings
    \item Simulation animations
    \item Virtual reality walkthroughs
    \item Video demonstrations from home institution
\end{itemize}

No special safety requirements or advance notice needed for Level 0.

\subsubsection{Level 1: Static Display}
Physical hardware without power. Requirements:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Transport documentation with customs declarations
    \item Assembly/disassembly procedures
    \item Material safety data sheets for all components
    \item Display area maximum 2m × 2m
    \item Team responsible for setup/teardown
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Level 2: Powered Demonstration}
RF testing without beam. Strict requirements:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item 60-day advance notice mandatory
    \item Complete risk assessment (form ELIAC-DEMO-002)
    \item Insurance certificate (€1,000,000 minimum coverage)
    \item Two qualified operators (one must be faculty/staff)
    \item Emergency stop system demonstration video
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Safety Protocol for Powered Demonstrations}

\subsubsection{Pre-Event Requirements (T-60 days)}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Submit initial demonstration request
    \item Provide system specifications and schematics
    \item Identify all hazards and mitigation measures
    \item Submit operator qualifications
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Pre-Event Requirements (T-30 days)}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Submit complete safety documentation package
    \item Provide test reports from certified laboratory
    \item Insurance documentation finalized
    \item Transport arrangements confirmed
    \item Venue technical requirements verified
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{On-Site Safety Inspection}
Day 1 requirements before operation permitted:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Safety inspection by committee and venue officer
    \item Interlock system verification
    \item RF leakage test (<1 mW/cm² at 5cm)
    \item Grounding verification (<0.1$\Omega$)
    \item Emergency stop functionality test
    \item Signage and barriers installed
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Operating Limits}

\subsubsection{}
Maximum permitted parameters for demonstrations:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item RF Power: 100W continuous or 1kW pulsed (10\% duty cycle)
    \item Voltage: 5kV DC, 1kV AC RMS
    \item Vacuum: No turbomolecular pumps in public areas
    \item Cryogenics: Maximum 5 liters liquid nitrogen
    \item Laser: Class 2 maximum in open areas
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{}
Public must be maintained minimum 2 meters from equipment. Operators must wear appropriate PPE. Committee observer required during all operations.

\subsection{Case-by-Case Evaluation}

\subsubsection{}
Teams requesting demonstrations beyond standard categories undergo individual review:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Novel demonstration types considered
    \item Additional safety measures may be required
    \item Venue capabilities determine feasibility
    \item Educational value weighed against risk
    \item Committee decision final
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{}
Approval does not guarantee demonstration if venue conditions change or safety concerns arise during setup.

\subsection{Liability and Insurance}

\subsubsection{}
Teams assume full responsibility for:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Equipment damage during transport or demonstration
    \item Personal injury resulting from team equipment
    \item Third-party claims arising from demonstration
    \item Venue damage caused by team activities
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{}
University or team insurance must explicitly cover competition activities. Proof required before demonstration approval.

\subsection{Recognition for Demonstrations}

\subsubsection{}
While demonstrations don't affect competition scoring, special recognition provided:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Best Hardware Implementation award
    \item Innovation in Construction award
    \item Feature in ELIAC Magazine hardware section
    \item Video documentation for competition archive
    \item Industry networking opportunities
\end{itemize}

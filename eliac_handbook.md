## I Introduction

### I.1 Purpose

#### I.1.1
The European Linear Accelerator Challenge (ELIAC) is the first international academic challenge focused on particle accelerators, specifically on the design and development of an electron Linear Accelerator (LINAC). This initiative aims to foster collaboration between teams from different countries and specialties, while facing the challenge of developing a particle acceleration system with potential applications in different industry and research fields.

#### I.1.2
ELIAC is not limited to the development of a specific linear accelerator model, but also aims to strengthen international synergies in the academic and research fields, promoting teamwork, innovation, and knowledge exchange among students and professionals from different disciplines.

### I.2 Technical Approach

#### I.2.1
The electron linear accelerator (LINAC) was selected as the foundational model due to its relative structural simplicity and modular nature, characteristics that make it an ideal starting point for an academic competition of this kind.

#### I.2.2
Unlike circular accelerators such as cyclotrons or synchrotrons, a LINAC is based on a linear design that facilitates scalability and allows for more precise control of the energy delivered to the particles.

### I.3 Educational Philosophy

#### I.3.1
The approach emphasizes a bottom-up development process, where degree and master's students take an active role in every stage: from electromagnetic design and particle dynamics simulation to RF component selection, vacuum system integration, and beam diagnostics.

#### I.3.2
The educational objectives pursued are:
- Development of technical skills in advanced simulation tools
- Hands-on learning through practical application
- Interdisciplinary collaboration experience
- Professional development in a research environment

### I.4 Competition Scope

#### I.4.1
The competition focuses on the design and simulation of electron LINAC prototypes. Physical construction is encouraged for demonstration purposes but is not scored. Teams design complete systems while specializing in areas of strength.

#### I.4.2
There are no constraints on beam energy or accelerator length, provided designs are safe and serve a stated objective. Teams must define a specific application context for their design.

## B Technical Glossary

### B.1 Accelerator Components

**Accelerating Cavity** - Resonant metallic structure where electromagnetic fields accelerate particles. Can be normal-conducting or superconducting.

**Beam Position Monitor (BPM)** - Diagnostic device that measures the transverse position of the particle beam within the beampipe.

**Buncher** - RF cavity operating at low energy to compress particle bunches longitudinally before main acceleration.

**Cathode** - Electron-emitting surface in an electron gun. Can be thermionic (heated), photocathode (laser-driven), or field emission.

**Coupler** - Device for transferring RF power from transmission line into accelerating cavity. Can be capacitive, inductive, or waveguide-based.

**Electron Gun** - Source of electrons for acceleration. Includes cathode, extraction electrode, and focusing elements.

**Faraday Cup** - Simple beam diagnostic that collects all beam current for measurement.

**Klystron** - High-power RF amplifier tube commonly used to drive accelerating structures.

**Quadrupole** - Magnet with four poles used for transverse beam focusing. Focuses in one plane while defocusing in the other.

**RF Window** - Vacuum barrier transparent to RF power, typically made of ceramic or sapphire.

**Solenoid** - Cylindrical coil producing longitudinal magnetic field for beam focusing, especially at low energy.

**Waveguide** - Hollow metallic tube for RF power transmission with low loss.

### B.2 Performance Metrics

**Beam Loading** - Reduction in cavity voltage due to energy extraction by the beam.

**Duty Cycle** - Ratio of pulse duration to repetition period for pulsed operation.

**Emittance** - Measure of beam quality in phase space. Product of beam size and angular divergence. Units: mm-mrad.

**Energy Spread** - RMS or FWHM variation in particle energies within the beam. Expressed as percentage or absolute value.

**Gradient** - Accelerating electric field strength, typically expressed in MV/m. Key figure of merit for accelerating structures.

**Quality Factor (Q)** - Ratio of stored energy to energy loss per RF cycle. Indicates cavity efficiency.

**Repetition Rate** - Frequency of beam pulses, typically in Hz.

**Shunt Impedance** - Measure of cavity efficiency relating voltage gain to power consumption. Units: MΩ/m.

**Transit Time Factor** - Efficiency factor accounting for particle velocity change during acceleration.

**Wake Field** - Electromagnetic field left behind by beam that can affect following particles.

### B.3 Simulation Terms

**Convergence Study** - Systematic refinement of mesh or parameters to ensure simulation accuracy.

**Eigenmode** - Natural resonant mode of electromagnetic cavity.

**Mesh** - Discretization of geometry for numerical simulation.

**Particle-In-Cell (PIC)** - Simulation method tracking individual particles in self-consistent fields.

**S-Parameters** - Scattering parameters describing RF network behavior.

**Space Charge** - Collective electromagnetic field of beam affecting particle dynamics.

### B.4 Operational Terms

**Conditioning** - Process of gradually increasing cavity field to eliminate field emission sites.

**Interlock** - Safety system preventing operation under unsafe conditions.

**Multipacting** - Resonant secondary electron emission limiting achievable field.

**Quench** - Loss of superconductivity due to heating or excessive field.

**Vacuum Breakdown** - Electrical discharge in vacuum at high field strength.
